## 🔒 **Data Safety & Validation**

### **🛡️ Work Type Validation**
- **Required Fields**: Name cannot be empty
- **Unique Names**: Prevents duplicate work type names
- **Color Defaults**: Falls back to blue if color is missing
- **Store Isolation**: Work types are store-specific

### **👤 Employee Validation**
- **Required Assignment**: Must select at least one work type (when available)
- **Valid Work Types**: Only allows assignment of existing work types
- **Store Consistency**: Work types must belong to employee's store
- **Graceful Fallback**: Auto-assigns first work type if none selected

### **🔐 Security & Permissions**
- **User Authentication**: All APIs require valid user session
- **Store Ownership**: Users can only manage their own stores
- **Data Isolation**: Work types and assignments are store-scoped
- **Transaction Safety**: Database operations use transactions

## 🚀 **Advanced Features**

### **🎨 Smart Color Management**
```typescript
// Readable text color calculation
const chipText = readableTextColor(workType.color);
// Returns white text for dark colors, black for light colors

// Color picker with live preview
<input 
  type="color" 
  value={draft.color}
  onChange={updateColor}
  className="h-8 w-12 rounded"
/>
```

### **📱 Responsive Design**
