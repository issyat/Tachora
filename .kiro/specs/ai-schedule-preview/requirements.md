# AI Schedule Preview System - Requirements

## Introduction

The AI Schedule Preview System allows the virtual scheduling manager to propose changes that are visually displayed in the calendar with different colors before being applied. This creates a clear preview → approval → apply workflow that gives managers full control over AI-suggested changes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Visual Change Preview

**User Story:** As a manager, I want to see AI-proposed schedule changes highlighted in the calendar with different colors, so that I can visually review what will change before approving.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI proposes schedule changes THEN the changes SHALL appear as colored overlays on the calendar
2. WHEN changes are proposed THEN removed assignments SHALL be highlighted in red with strikethrough
3. WHEN changes are proposed THEN new assignments SHALL be highlighted in green with a "PROPOSED" badge
4. WHEN changes are proposed THEN modified assignments SHALL be highlighted in orange with change indicators
5. WHEN no changes are pending THEN the calendar SHALL display normal colors without overlays

### Requirement 2: Change Management Interface

**User Story:** As a manager, I want clear controls to approve or reject AI-proposed changes, so that I have full control over what gets applied to my schedule.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN changes are proposed THEN an approval panel SHALL appear with "Accept" and "Reject" buttons
2. WHEN I click "Accept" THEN all proposed changes SHALL be applied to the actual schedule
3. WHEN I click "Reject" THEN all proposed changes SHALL be discarded and calendar returns to normal
4. WHEN changes are pending THEN the approval panel SHALL show a summary of what will change
5. WHEN I navigate away THEN pending changes SHALL be automatically discarded

### Requirement 3: AI Integration with Preview

**User Story:** As a manager, I want the AI to generate specific change proposals that I can preview, so that I understand exactly what the AI wants to change before it happens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I ask the AI for schedule adjustments THEN it SHALL generate specific change proposals
2. WHEN the AI proposes changes THEN it SHALL include employee names, days, times, and reasons
3. WHEN changes are generated THEN they SHALL be structured as add/remove/modify operations
4. WHEN the AI explains changes THEN it SHALL reference the visual preview in the calendar
5. WHEN changes are complex THEN the AI SHALL break them into clear, reviewable steps

### Requirement 4: Change Validation

**User Story:** As a manager, I want the system to validate AI-proposed changes against business rules, so that only feasible changes are proposed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI proposes changes THEN the system SHALL validate employee availability
2. WHEN the AI proposes changes THEN the system SHALL check weekly hour limits
3. WHEN the AI proposes changes THEN the system SHALL verify work type compatibility
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the AI SHALL explain why the change isn't possible
5. WHEN changes are valid THEN they SHALL be marked as "Ready to Apply"

### Requirement 5: Multi-Change Scenarios

**User Story:** As a manager, I want to preview multiple related changes as a single scenario, so that I can understand the full impact before approving.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI proposes multiple changes THEN they SHALL be grouped as one scenario
2. WHEN reviewing scenarios THEN I SHALL see all changes highlighted simultaneously
3. WHEN I approve a scenario THEN all changes SHALL be applied atomically
4. WHEN I reject a scenario THEN all changes SHALL be discarded together
5. WHEN scenarios conflict THEN the system SHALL prevent overlapping proposals

### Requirement 6: Change History and Rollback

**User Story:** As a manager, I want to see what changes were made by the AI and be able to undo them if needed, so that I can maintain control over my schedule.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI changes are applied THEN they SHALL be logged with timestamps and reasons
2. WHEN I view change history THEN I SHALL see who/what made each change
3. WHEN I want to undo THEN I SHALL be able to rollback recent AI changes
4. WHEN changes are rolled back THEN affected employees SHALL be notified
5. WHEN viewing history THEN I SHALL see before/after states for each change

### Requirement 7: Real-time Collaboration

**User Story:** As a manager, I want other managers to see when AI changes are pending, so that we don't make conflicting edits simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN changes are pending THEN other users SHALL see a "Changes Pending" indicator
2. WHEN another manager has pending changes THEN I SHALL be warned before making edits
3. WHEN changes are applied THEN all connected users SHALL see the updates immediately
4. WHEN conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL show clear conflict resolution options
5. WHEN collaboration is active THEN user actions SHALL be clearly attributed

### Requirement 8: Mobile Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a manager using mobile devices, I want the preview system to work clearly on smaller screens, so that I can review and approve changes anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using mobile devices THEN change previews SHALL be clearly visible
2. WHEN on mobile THEN approval controls SHALL be easily accessible
3. WHEN viewing changes THEN text SHALL be readable without zooming
4. WHEN interacting THEN buttons SHALL be appropriately sized for touch
5. WHEN space is limited THEN the interface SHALL prioritize essential information
