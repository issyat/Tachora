# Simplified Shift Display - Exactly What You Wanted

## What You Asked For:
> "The only shifts I create in the shifts page should be displayed in the calendar and I can drag and drop the employees to them"

## What I Fixed:

### âœ… **All Your Shifts Are Now Visible**
- Every shift you create in the Shifts page now appears in the calendar
- No more hidden shifts or confusing states
- Simple and direct: create shift â†’ see shift â†’ assign employee

### âœ… **Simplified Visual Design**
- **ðŸŸ¢ Green**: Shift with employee assigned
- **ðŸ”µ Blue**: Shift waiting for employee assignment
- No more orange templates or confusing states

### âœ… **Direct Drag & Drop**
- Drag any employee to any blue shift block
- Automatically creates the assignment
- Shift turns green when employee is assigned

## How It Works Now:

1. **Create shifts** in the Shifts page (Cashier Mon-Fri 9-17, etc.)
2. **See all shifts** in the calendar as blue blocks
3. **Drag employees** to any blue block to assign them
4. **Block turns green** and shows employee name

## Technical Changes Made:

### 1. **Unified Display Logic**
```typescript
// Show ALL shifts from templates - this is what the user expects
for (const template of templates) {
  // Check if there's an assignment for this template shift
  const existingAssignment = assignmentMap.get(assignmentKey);
  
  // Always show the shift - either with assignment data or as unassigned
  dayMap[d.key].push({
    role: template.role,
    startMin: s,
    endMin: e,
    assignment: existingAssignment // Will be undefined if no assignment exists
  });
}
```

### 2. **Simplified Styling**
- Removed orange "template" styling
- Only two states: assigned (green) or unassigned (blue)
- Clear, simple visual distinction

### 3. **Direct Assignment**
- When you drag to a shift, it either:
  - Updates existing assignment (if one exists)
  - Creates new assignment (if none exists)
- No more complex template vs assignment logic

## Result:
**Exactly what you wanted**: Simple, direct workflow where shifts you create are visible and assignable through drag & drop.

No more confusion about templates vs assignments - just shifts that you can assign employees to!
