## 🔧 **Technical Architecture**

### **🗄️ Database Schema**
```sql
-- Core entities
Store (id, name, openingTime, closingTime)
Employee (id, name, weeklyMinutesTarget, canWorkAcrossStores)
WorkType (id, name, color)
ShiftTemplate (id, workTypeId, days, startTime, endTime)

-- Relationships
EmployeeWorkType (employeeId, workTypeId)
Availability (employeeId, day, startTime, endTime, isOff)
Assignment (id, employeeId, day, startTime, endTime, locked)
```

### **🚀 API Endpoints**
```typescript
// Schedule management
GET  /api/schedule/assignments    // Fetch current assignments
POST /api/schedule/generate       // AI generate with CP-SAT
POST /api/schedule/assignments    // Manual assignment creation
DELETE /api/schedule/assignments  // Remove assignments

// Employee management  
GET  /api/setup                   // Fetch employees, stores, work types
POST /api/employees               // Save employee data
POST /api/employees/work-types    // Assign work types

// Store management
GET  /api/stores                  // Fetch all stores
POST /api/stores                  // Create new store
POST /api/store                   // Update existing store
```

### **🎯 CP-SAT Solver Logic**
```python
# Constraint satisfaction process
1. Load employees with availability windows
2. Load shift templates requiring coverage
3. For each shift:
   - Find available employees
   - Filter by work type compatibility
   - Rank by current workload (prefer under-target)
   - Assign optimal candidate
4. Validate all constraints satisfied
5. Return optimized assignment set
```
