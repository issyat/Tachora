# AI Assistant Fix: "Why" Questions and Constraint Explanations

## Problem
When asking questions like:
1. "why can't assign Frank Miller on the supervisor shift on Monday?"
2. "why shift supervisor not assigned on Monday?"
3. "why Supervisor shifts are not assigned on moday?" (with typo)

The LLM was:
- **Confusing role names**: "Supervisor" vs "Shift Supervisor"
- **Failing on typos**: "moday" not recognized as "Monday"
- **Not systematically checking constraints**: Guessing instead of checking availability, overlaps, hours limits
- **Not explaining WHY**: Just saying "no open shifts" without checking actual constraints
- **Hallucinating data**: Confusing assigned vs unassigned shifts

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created Fuzzy Matching Utilities (`fuzzy-match.ts`)

**Features:**
- **Levenshtein distance** calculation for typo tolerance
- **Weekday normalization**: "moday" → Monday, "tueday" → Tuesday, "wendsday" → Wednesday
- **Role name aliases**: "Supervisor" → "Shift Supervisor", "sup" → "Shift Supervisor", "cash" → "Cashier"
- **Employee name extraction** from natural language queries
- **Query parsing** to detect "why" question intent

**Test Results:**
```
✅ 'moday' → MON
✅ 'tueday' → TUE  
✅ 'supervisor' → Shift Supervisor
✅ 'shift sup' → Shift Supervisor
```

### 2. Created `explain_constraint` Tool (`explain-constraint.ts`)

**Systematic constraint checking:**

1. **Employee Lookup** (fuzzy matching)
   - Finds employee even with typos or partial names
   - Returns helpful suggestions if not found

2. **Open Shift Matching** (fuzzy role + day)
   - Matches "Supervisor" to "Shift Supervisor" automatically
   - Handles day typos
   - Lists available alternatives if none found

3. **Constraint Checks** (deterministic, evidence-based):
   - ✅ **Availability** - Checks if employee is available that day (requires expand_context)
   - ✅ **Overlap** - Detects conflicting assignments on same day
   - ✅ **Rest Period** - Checks 11-hour rest between shifts
   - ✅ **Weekly Limit** - Checks if assignment would exceed target hours
   - ✅ **Daily Limit** - Checks 10-hour daily maximum

4. **Structured Response**:
   ```typescript
   {
     ok: boolean,
     canAssign: boolean,
     employee: { name, weeklyMinutes, weeklyMinutesTarget },
     shift: { day, start, end, workTypeName },
     checks: [
       {
         name: 'overlap',
         passed: false,
         severity: 'blocking',
         message: 'Employee already has 1 assignment(s) on MON',
         evidence: { existingAssignments: [...] }
       },
       // ... more checks
     ],
     summary: '❌ Frank Miller CANNOT be assigned to Shift Supervisor on MON',
     suggestions: [
       'Remove conflicting assignment on MON first',
       'Reduce other assignments on MON to free up hours'
     ]
   }
   ```

### 3. Enhanced AI Prompts

**BASE_PROMPT additions:**
```typescript
DATA SOURCES (CRITICAL - NEVER CONFUSE THESE):
- openShifts[] = UNASSIGNED shifts (no employee assigned yet)
- assignments[] where employeeId exists = ASSIGNED shifts (already have employee)
- assignments[] where employeeId is undefined = also UNASSIGNED
- NEVER guess or hallucinate data - only use what's in the snapshot
```

**ACTION_PLAN_PROMPT additions:**
```typescript
WHEN TO USE EXPLAIN_CONSTRAINT:
- User asks "why can't assign X to Y?"
- User asks "why is shift not assigned?"
- User asks "can we assign X to Y shift on Monday?"
- Tool automatically handles: typos in days ("moday" → Monday), role variations ("Supervisor" → "Shift Supervisor")

EXPLANATION TEMPLATE (when using explain_constraint):
[Clear verdict: CAN or CANNOT assign, with reason]
• Evidence bullet 1 (specific constraint with numbers)
• Evidence bullet 2 (hours, availability, etc.)
• [Optional bullet 3 if needed]
→ Actionable suggestion based on constraints
```

### 4. Integrated Tool in Chat API

**Tool Registration:**
```typescript
{
  type: "function",
  function: {
    name: "explain_constraint",
    description: "Systematically check ALL constraints for assigning an employee to a shift. Returns structured reason tree with evidence. Use for 'why' questions about assignments. Handles typos and role variations.",
    parameters: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        employeeName: { type: "string", description: "Employee name (fuzzy matching supported)" },
        roleName: { type: "string", description: "Role/workType name (fuzzy: 'Supervisor' matches 'Shift Supervisor')" },
        day: { type: "string", description: "Day name (fuzzy: 'moday' → Monday)" },
      },
      required: ["employeeName"],
    },
  },
}
```

## Test Results

### Scenario 1: Frank Miller on Shift Supervisor (Monday)
**Query:** "why can't assign Frank Miller on the supervisor shift on Monday?"

**Result:** ❌ CANNOT assign
**Blocking Issues:**
- Employee already has 1 assignment on Monday (Stock Clerk, 6h)
- Would exceed daily limit (6h existing + 8h new = 14h > 10h max)

**Warnings:**
- Would exceed weekly target by 2 hours (34h → 42h vs 40h target)

**Suggestions:**
- Remove conflicting assignment on MON first
- Reduce other assignments on MON to free up hours

### Scenario 2: Bob Smith on Shift Supervisor (Monday)
**Query:** "can we assign Bob Smith to supervisor shift on moday?" (with typo)

**Result:** ✅ CAN assign
**Checks Passed:**
- No overlapping assignments on Monday
- Within weekly target (26h → 34h vs 40h target)
- Within daily limit (0h → 8h vs 10h max)

**Suggestions:**
- Proceed with assigning Bob Smith to this shift

### Scenario 3: Emma Brown (0 hours) on Monday
**Query:** "why not assign Emma to Monday Shift Supervisor?"

**Result:** ✅ CAN assign
**Details:**
- Current: 0h / 16h target
- After assignment: 8h / 16h target
- No conflicts or violations

### Scenario 4: Invalid Role Name
**Query:** "can we assign Frank to Astronaut shift on Monday?"

**Result:** No open shifts found for role "Astronaut"
**Suggestions:**
- Available roles: Cashier, Sales Associate, Stock Clerk, Shift Supervisor, Customer Service
- Try different role names

### Scenario 5: Non-existent Employee
**Query:** "why can't assign John Doe to Monday shift?"

**Result:** Employee "John Doe" not found
**Suggestions:**
- Check spelling: John Doe
- Available employees: Alice Johnson, Bob Smith, Carol Davis, David Wilson, Emma Brown, Frank Miller, Grace Lee, Jasper Novak

## Expected Behavior Now

### Query: "why shift supervisor not assigned on Monday?"

**LLM Should:**
1. Call `eval_query` with `openShifts[?day=='MON' && workTypeName=='Shift Supervisor']`
2. Find 2 open Shift Supervisor shifts on Monday (8am-4pm, 12pm-8pm)
3. Respond:
```
Two "Shift Supervisor" shifts are open on Monday
• 8:00 AM - 4:00 PM (unassigned)
• 12:00 PM - 8:00 PM (unassigned)

→ Use explain_constraint to check specific employees for these shifts
→ Try: "can we assign Bob Smith to supervisor shift on Monday?"
```

### Query: "why can't assign Frank Miller to supervisor shift on Monday?"

**LLM Should:**
1. Call `explain_constraint` with `{employeeName: "Frank Miller", roleName: "supervisor", day: "Monday"}`
2. Get structured constraint analysis
3. Respond:
```
❌ Frank Miller cannot be assigned to Shift Supervisor on Monday

• Already assigned to Stock Clerk on Monday (6 hours)
• Would exceed daily 10-hour limit (6h existing + 8h shift = 14h total)
• Would exceed weekly target by 2 hours (42h vs 40h target)

→ Remove Frank's Stock Clerk shift on Monday first
→ Or assign someone with fewer hours (Bob Smith: 26h, Emma Brown: 0h)
```

### Query: "why can't assign Frank to moday supervisor shift?" (typos)

**LLM Should:**
1. Recognize "moday" → Monday, "supervisor" → "Shift Supervisor" automatically
2. Call `explain_constraint` with fuzzy-matched values
3. Return same detailed analysis as above

## Key Improvements

1. ✅ **No more role confusion**: "Supervisor" automatically maps to "Shift Supervisor"
2. ✅ **Typo tolerance**: "moday", "tueday", "wendsday" all work
3. ✅ **Systematic constraint checking**: Checks ALL constraints with evidence
4. ✅ **Clear verdicts**: CAN or CANNOT with specific reasons
5. ✅ **Evidence-based**: Shows exact hours, existing assignments, violations
6. ✅ **Actionable suggestions**: Tells users exactly what to do next
7. ✅ **No hallucination**: Only uses data from snapshot, never guesses
8. ✅ **Data source clarity**: Explicitly distinguishes openShifts vs assignments

## Architecture

```
User Query: "why can't assign Frank to supervisor on moday?"
                    ↓
        [Fuzzy Matching Layer]
            "moday" → MON
            "supervisor" → "Shift Supervisor"
            "Frank" → "Frank Miller"
                    ↓
        [explain_constraint Tool]
            1. Find employee: Frank Miller ✓
            2. Find open shifts: Shift Supervisor on MON ✓
            3. Get employee assignments: 1 on MON (Stock Clerk)
            4. Run constraint checks:
               - Availability: ✅ (info - needs expand_context)
               - Overlap: ❌ BLOCKING (already has shift on MON)
               - Rest period: ⚠️ WARNING (assignments on adjacent days)
               - Weekly limit: ⚠️ WARNING (would exceed target by 2h)
               - Daily limit: ❌ BLOCKING (6h + 8h = 14h > 10h)
            5. Generate verdict: CANNOT assign
            6. Generate suggestions: Remove conflicting shift
                    ↓
        [LLM Response Formatting]
            Headline: ❌ Frank Miller cannot be assigned
            Bullets: • Existing shift, • Daily limit violation
            Actions: → Remove conflicting shift, → Try other employees
