# Work Type Action Button Feature

## Overview

When a user tries to create a shift with a non-existent work type, the AI assistant now provides a helpful error message with an action button that navigates the user directly to the Work Types setup page.

## User Experience Flow

### Before (❌ Old Behavior)
```
User: "add supervisor shift on mon from 9 to 15"
AI: "I couldn't find a work type named 'Supervisor'. Please check the name or create the work type first."
User: "...?" (confused, doesn't know how to create work type)
```

### After (✅ New Behavior)
```
User: "add supervisor shift on mon from 9 to 15"
AI: "❌ Cannot create shift: Work type 'Supervisor' doesn't exist.

Available work types: Cashier, Sales Associate

To create this shift, you need to add the 'Supervisor' work type first.

[+ Create Work Type] <-- Clickable button
You'll be able to create 'Supervisor' in the Work Types section"

User: *clicks button* → Redirected to /setup?tab=work-types
User: Creates "Supervisor" work type
User: Returns to chat → "add supervisor shift on mon from 9 to 15"
AI: ✅ Creates shift with preview
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Handler Response Enhancement
**File**: `src/server/preview/llm-handlers.ts`

When work type is not found in `handleCreateShiftTemplate()`:
```typescript
return {
  ok: false,
  error: `Work type "${workTypeName}" not found`,
  errorCode: 'WORK_TYPE_NOT_FOUND',
  message: `❌ Cannot create shift: Work type "${workTypeName}" doesn't exist.\n\n` +
    (existingWorkTypes.length > 0 
      ? `Available work types: ${existingNames}\n\n` 
      : '') +
    `To create this shift, you need to add the "${workTypeName}" work type first.`,
  data: {
    missingWorkType: workTypeName,
    existingWorkTypes: existingWorkTypes.map(wt => wt.name),
    actionRequired: 'create_work_type',
    actionUrl: '/setup?tab=work-types',
  },
};
```

**Key Fields**:
- `actionRequired`: Identifies the type of action (e.g., 'create_work_type')
- `actionUrl`: Target URL for the action button
- `actionData`: Additional context (missing work type name, existing types)

### 2. Chat API Response Extension
**File**: `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`

Added tracking variables:
```typescript
let actionRequired: string | undefined;
let actionUrl: string | undefined;
let actionData: any | undefined;
```

Capture action data from tool results:
```typescript
if (!result.ok && result.data) {
  const resultData = result.data as any;
  if (resultData.actionRequired) {
    actionRequired = resultData.actionRequired;
    actionUrl = resultData.actionUrl;
    actionData = resultData.actionData;
  }
}
```

Include in response:
```typescript
if (actionRequired) {
  responsePayload.actionRequired = actionRequired;
  responsePayload.actionUrl = actionUrl;
  responsePayload.actionData = actionData;
}
```

### 3. Chat Component Enhancement
**File**: `src/app/(protected)/schedule/components/ScheduleChatAssistant.tsx`

Extended Message interface:
```typescript
interface Message {
  role: "user" | "assistant";
  content: string;
  actionRequired?: string; // e.g., 'create_work_type'
  actionUrl?: string; // e.g., '/setup?tab=work-types'
  actionData?: any; // Additional data for the action
}
```

Capture action data from API response:
```typescript
const actionMessage: Message = {
  role: 'assistant',
  content: reply,
};

if (data.actionRequired) {
  actionMessage.actionRequired = data.actionRequired;
  actionMessage.actionUrl = data.actionUrl;
  actionMessage.actionData = data.actionData;
}

setMessages((current) => [...current, actionMessage]);
```

Render action button in message:
```tsx
{message.actionRequired === 'create_work_type' && message.actionUrl && (
  <div className="mt-3 pt-3 border-t border-slate-200">
    <a
      href={message.actionUrl}
      className="inline-flex items-center gap-2 px-4 py-2 text-sm font-medium text-white bg-blue-600 rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-700 transition-colors"
    >
      <svg className="h-4 w-4" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor">
        <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" strokeWidth={2} d="M12 4v16m8-8H4" />
      </svg>
      Create Work Type
    </a>
    {message.actionData?.missingWorkType && (
      <div className="mt-2 text-xs text-slate-600">
        You'll be able to create "{message.actionData.missingWorkType}" in the Work Types section
      </div>
    )}
  </div>
)}
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Improved User Experience**
- ✅ Clear guidance when action is needed
- ✅ One-click navigation to correct page
- ✅ Context preserved (knows which work type to create)
- ✅ Reduces user confusion and support requests

### 2. **Contextual Help**
- Shows existing work types for reference
- Explains exactly what's missing
- Provides actionable solution

### 3. **Seamless Workflow**
- User doesn't need to search for settings
- Direct link to relevant section
- Can return to chat after creating work type

### 4. **Extensible Pattern**
This pattern can be reused for other scenarios:
- Missing employees: "Create Employee" button
- Missing roles: "Add Role" button
- Invalid settings: "Fix Configuration" button

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: No Work Types Exist Yet
```
User: "add cashier shift mon 9-15"
AI: "❌ Cannot create shift: Work type 'Cashier' doesn't exist.

To create this shift, you need to add the 'Cashier' work type first.

[+ Create Work Type]
You'll be able to create 'Cashier' in the Work Types section"
```

### Scenario 2: Some Work Types Exist
```
User: "add supervisor shift mon 9-15"
AI: "❌ Cannot create shift: Work type 'Supervisor' doesn't exist.

Available work types: Cashier, Sales Associate, Stocker

To create this shift, you need to add the 'Supervisor' work type first.

[+ Create Work Type]
You'll be able to create 'Supervisor' in the Work Types section"
```

### Scenario 3: After Creating Work Type
```
User: *creates "Supervisor" work type*
User: *returns to chat*
User: "add supervisor shift mon 9-15"
AI: "✓ Preview created: New Supervisor shift MON 09:00-15:00 (6h). No conflicts. Apply?"
```

## Technical Notes

### URL Format
- Uses query parameter: `/setup?tab=work-types`
- This opens the setup page with the Work Types tab pre-selected
- User can immediately see the "Create Work Type" form

### Action Data Structure
```typescript
{
  missingWorkType: "Supervisor",        // Work type user tried to create
  existingWorkTypes: ["Cashier", ...],  // Currently available types
  actionRequired: "create_work_type",   // Action identifier
  actionUrl: "/setup?tab=work-types"    // Target URL
}
```

### Button Styling
- Blue button (primary action)
- Icon (+ symbol) for visual clarity
- Hover effect for interactivity
- Helper text below button for context

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Auto-Populate Form
- Pass work type name in URL: `/setup?tab=work-types&name=Supervisor`
- Pre-fill the work type name in the creation form
- User just needs to set color and confirm

### 2. Modal Instead of Navigation
- Show work type creation form in modal
- User stays in chat context
- Seamless experience without page change

### 3. Quick Create
- Inline "Create & Retry" button
- Creates work type with defaults
- Immediately retries shift creation

### 4. Suggestions
- AI suggests similar work types: "Did you mean 'Shift Supervisor'?"
- Fuzzy matching for common typos
- Learn from past corrections

## Testing

### Manual Test Cases

✅ **Test 1: Non-existent work type**
```
User: "add manager shift mon 8-16"
Expected: Error message + "Create Work Type" button
```

✅ **Test 2: Button click navigation**
```
User: *clicks "Create Work Type" button*
Expected: Redirected to /setup?tab=work-types
```

✅ **Test 3: After creating work type**
```
User: *creates work type*
User: "add manager shift mon 8-16"
Expected: Preview created successfully
```

✅ **Test 4: Existing work types listed**
```
User: "add xyz shift mon 8-16" (with 3 existing work types)
Expected: Error lists all 3 existing types
```

✅ **Test 5: No existing work types**
```
User: "add cashier shift mon 8-16" (no work types exist)
Expected: Error without "Available work types" section
```

## Conclusion

This feature significantly improves the user experience when creating shifts with non-existent work types. Instead of showing a generic error, the system now:

1. Clearly explains the problem
2. Shows what exists (for context)
3. Provides a one-click solution
4. Maintains user context

The implementation is extensible and can be adapted for other "missing prerequisite" scenarios throughout the application.
