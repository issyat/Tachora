# AnswerPack Assistant - Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

A new Q&A system for the schedule assistant that fetches all data in a single operation and uses GPT-4 to reason over it, returning answers in a consistent 4-section format.

## Files Created

### 1. Data Fetch Layer
**`src/server/copilot/data/answer-pack.ts`** (320 lines)
- `fetchAnswerPack()` - Single operation that returns complete JSON snapshot
- Fetches: employees, schedules, assignments, availability, roles, hours, unassigned counts
- Applies tenant/store scoping security
- Max limits: 250 employees, 1000 assignments
- Published schedules only (by default)
- Calculates hours and unassigned totals
- Returns structured AnswerPack with metadata

### 2. API Route
**`src/app/api/copilot/answer-pack/route.ts`** (110 lines)
- POST endpoint at `/api/copilot/answer-pack`
- Validates Clerk authentication
- Extracts parameters from request (storeId, isoWeek, filters)
- Calls fetchAnswerPack()
- Uses LLM to reason over JSON
- Returns formatted answer with performance metadata
- Comprehensive error handling

### 3. LLM Reasoning
**`src/server/copilot/answer-pack-llm.ts`** (170 lines)
- `answerFromPack()` - Uses GPT-4o-mini to reason over JSON
- **Supports both Azure OpenAI and standard OpenAI**
- Uses same Azure config as existing assistant (AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY, AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT, AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME)
- Enforces 4-section format: **Scope** / **Assumptions** / **Sources** / **Answer**
- Comprehensive system prompt with rules and examples
- Low temperature (0.1) for consistent, factual answers
- Handles missing data explicitly
- Never hallucinates or speculates

### 4. UI Component
**`src/app/(protected)/schedule/components/AnswerPackAssistant.tsx`** (210 lines)
- React component with question input
- Loading states with spinner
- Error handling
- 4-section formatted output display
- Performance metadata (collapsible)
- Example questions
- "Include other stores" toggle
- Fetched timestamp

### 5. Configuration
**`.env.local`** (updated)
- Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANSWERPACK_ASSISTANT=false` flag
- Added `OPENAI_API_KEY` placeholder
- Feature can be toggled without code changes

**`src/app/(protected)/schedule/page.tsx`** (updated)
- Conditionally renders AnswerPackAssistant vs ScheduleCopilotAssistant
- Based on `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANSWERPACK_ASSISTANT` env var

### 6. Documentation
**`ANSWERPACK_TESTING_GUIDE.md`** (complete testing guide)
- How to enable the feature
- Test queries for all 4 question types
- Expected answer formats
- Validation checklist
- Performance expectations
- Troubleshooting
- Comparison with old system

## Architecture

```
User Question
    ↓
AnswerPackAssistant Component (client)
    ↓
POST /api/copilot/answer-pack
    ↓
fetchAnswerPack() - Single DB fetch
    ├─ Employees + roles + availability
    ├─ Schedules (Published only)
    ├─ Assignments
    ├─ Calculated hours
    └─ Unassigned counts
    ↓
AnswerPack JSON (complete snapshot)

Display to user
```

## Key Features

### 1. Single Data Fetch
- All data fetched in one operation
- No cascading queries
- Predictable performance
- Complete snapshot for reasoning

### 2. Consistent Format
Every answer has exactly 4 sections:
- **Scope**: What data we're looking at (stores, week, filters)
- **Assumptions**: Interpretations or defaults applied
- **Sources**: DB entities used
- **Answer**: The actual answer with specifics

### 3. Security
- Tenant/store scoping enforced at fetch level
- Clerk authentication required
- Only manager's stores accessible
- Published schedules only (no draft leaks)

### 4. Observability
Built-in logging for every request:
- Fetch time (ms)
- LLM time (ms)
- Total time (ms)
- Payload size (KB)
- Record counts (employees, assignments, etc.)
- Sources used
- Timestamp

### 5. Feature Flag
- Toggle without code changes
- A/B testing ready
- Easy rollback if issues
- Can run side-by-side with old system

## Question Types Supported

### 1. Availability
- "Who can work [WorkType] on [Day]?"
- "Who is available [Day] [TimeWindow]?"
- Cross-store availability

### 2. Hours & Targets
- "Who is under their weekly target?"
- "Who is working more than target?"
- "How many hours is [Employee] scheduled?"

### 3. Coverage Gaps
- "Show unassigned shifts this week"
- "What [WorkType] shifts are unassigned?"
- "What's unassigned on [Day]?"

### 4. Schedule State
- "What's scheduled for next week?"
- Handles missing data gracefully

## Performance

Expected metrics:
- **Fetch time**: 200-500ms (depending on data size)
- **LLM time**: 1000-2000ms (GPT-4o-mini)
- **Total time**: < 3 seconds
- **Payload size**: 10-50 KB typical

## Limitations

1. **Published only**: Doesn't query Draft schedules
2. **Max limits**: 250 employees, 1000 assignments
3. **Read-only**: Cannot create/modify schedules (by design)
4. **Single week**: Queries one week at a time
5. **Current week best**: Optimized for current/recent weeks

## How to Test

1. **Your Azure OpenAI credentials should already be set** in `.env.local` (same as existing assistant)
2. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANSWERPACK_ASSISTANT=true` in `.env.local`
3. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to Schedule page
5. Follow `ANSWERPACK_TESTING_GUIDE.md`

## Next Steps

### Before Enabling in Production

1. **Verify Azure OpenAI Configuration**:
   - AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY is set
   - AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT is correct
   - AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME matches your GPT-4 deployment
   - Deployment has sufficient quota for additional load

2. **Run Manual Tests**:
   - Test all 4 question types
   - Verify 4-section format
   - Check accuracy vs UI/database
   - Test cross-store filtering
   - Test missing data handling

3. **Performance Validation**:
   - Monitor fetch + LLM times
   - Check payload sizes
   - Verify < 3 second total time

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Empty schedules
   - No employees
   - All shifts assigned
   - Large datasets (100+ employees)

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Query parsing**: Extract filters from natural language (work types, time windows)
2. **Multi-week queries**: "Show last 4 weeks hours"
3. **Draft schedules**: Optional flag to include Draft
4. **Caching**: Cache AnswerPack for same week/store
5. **Streaming**: Stream LLM response as it's generated
6. **Export**: Download answer as PDF/CSV

## Definition of Done ✅

All 7 requirements met:

1. ✅ **Fetch function**: fetchAnswerPack() returns complete JSON
2. ✅ **API route**: POST /api/copilot/answer-pack with auth & error handling
3. ✅ **LLM prompt**: answerFromPack() enforces 4-section format
4. ✅ **UI component**: AnswerPackAssistant with input, loading, formatted output
5. ✅ **Feature flag**: NEXT_PUBLIC_ANSWERPACK_ASSISTANT toggle
6. ✅ **Observability**: Logging for all timing, sizes, counts
7. ⏳ **Testing**: Ready to test (guide provided, waiting on OpenAI key)
