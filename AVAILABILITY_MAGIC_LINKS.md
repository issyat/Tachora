# Magic Link Availability System 🪄

A frictionless way for Student and Flexi employees to update their weekly availability without needing accounts or logins.

## 🎯 Problem Solved

- **Manager Pain**: Chasing Student/Flexi employees for availability updates

## ✨ How It Works

### For Managers
1. Click **"Request Availability"** button in the schedule page
2. System generates personal magic links for all Student & Flexi employees
3. Copy/send links via email, SMS, or messaging apps
4. Employees update their availability instantly
5. Data flows directly into your scheduling system

### For Employees  
1. Click the magic link (no login required)
2. See simple form: Monday-Sunday with time ranges
3. Check "Not available" or set start/end times
4. Submit → Done! ✅

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
-- New table for magic tokens
AvailabilityToken {
  id         String   @id @default(cuid())
  token      String   @unique

  expiresAt  DateTime  -- 7 days from creation
  usedAt     DateTime? -- Prevents reuse

}
```
